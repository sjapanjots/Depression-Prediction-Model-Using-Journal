# Depression-Prediction-Model-Using-Journal

## 🧠 Overview
**Depression-Prediction-Model-Using-Journal** is an end-to-end machine learning project focused on analyzing daily journal entries to estimate **mental health risk indicators**, such as depression likelihood, using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

The goal of this project is to explore how language patterns, emotional cues, and temporal trends in journaling data can be used to generate **responsible, explainable, and non-diagnostic mental health insights**.

> ⚠️ **Important:** This project does **NOT** provide medical diagnoses and is intended strictly for educational and research purposes.
